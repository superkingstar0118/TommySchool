ðŸš€ Project Title: Web-Based Feedback & Assessment Platform (MERN Stack)

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application designed for assessors to provide structured, rubric-based feedback for students across multiple schools, classes, and tasks. It streamlines assessment, automates PDF feedback generation, and centralizes result tracking for students and administrators.

ðŸ‘¥ User Roles:
There are 3 main roles, each with secure login and unique dashboards:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Assessor Role
Login:

Username/password authentication with secure sessions.

School/Class/Task Selection:

Dropdown or search fields to select:

School (pre-assigned by admin)

Class (e.g., 10A)

Student (from class list)

Task (e.g., "Text Response Essay")

Each task is linked to a specific rubric (5 types).

Rubric Submission:

Each rubric contains criteria scored from 1 (Bad) to 5 (Excellent).

Free-text comment box for additional feedback.

Save & Export:

On submission:

A PDF is auto-generated (e.g., JordanSmith_TaskA.pdf)

Columns: Student | Task | Criteria Scores | Total | Assessor (color-coded)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Student Role

ðŸ—‚ Folder/File Suggestions:
/client: React frontend

/server: Node.js backend API

/pdfs: Auto-generated feedback files

/uploads: CSV imports and school archives

/configs: Rubric templates

/scripts: Admin import/export tools

ðŸ“¦ Key Stack:
Frontend: React, TailwindCSS (for UI), React Router, Axios

Backend: Express.js, JWT, Multer (CSV handling), pdf-lib or Puppeteer (PDF generation)

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

Auth: JWT-based session management

File Storage: Local (or AWS S3/Cloudinary for production)

âœ… Replit Optimization Tips:
Use the monorepo template (client + server in one Replit workspace).

Install dependencies in package.json for both React and Express.

Use environment variables via .env for MongoDB URI, JWT secrets, etc.

Configure Replit's "Run" button to use concurrently:

json
Copy
Edit
"start": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
ðŸ’¡ Bonus Features (Optional for MVP):
Real-time PDF generation preview before saving

Email notifications when feedback is available

Admin audit logs (downloadable)
